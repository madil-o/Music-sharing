## Installation & Configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/madil-o/Better-Chesscom
cd Better-Chesscom
dune build
[your browser] src/index.html
```

Running the program for the first time will create the database, but you must create a key under the website/key directory. Then you just have to enter your song name (and artist for better accuracy) and copy the link.
